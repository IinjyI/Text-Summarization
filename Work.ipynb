However, this can be both a blessing and a curse. When not managed effectively, an over-reliance on these resources can build poor habits that will set you back long-term.\\nPersonally, I find myself pulling code from similar discussion threads several times, rather than taking the time to learn and solidify the concept so that I can reproduce the code myself the next time.\\nThis approach is lazy and while it may be the path of least resistance in the short-term, it will ultimately hurt your growth, productivity, and ability to recall syntax (cough, interviews) down the line.\\nRecently, I’ve been working through an online data science course titled Python for Data Science and Machine Learning on Udemy (Oh God, I sound like that guy on Youtube). Over the early lectures in the series, I was reminded of some concepts and syntax that I consistently overlook when performing data analysis in Python.\\nIn the interest of solidifying my understanding of these concepts once and for all and saving you guys a couple of StackOverflow searches, here’s the stuff that I’m always forgetting when working with Python, NumPy, and Pandas.\\nI’ve included a short description and example for each, however for your benefit, I will also include links to videos and other resources that explore each concept more in-depth as well.\\nWriting out a for loop every time you need to define some sort of list is tedious, luckily Python has a built-in way to address this problem in just one line of code. The syntax can be a little hard to wrap your head around but once you get familiar with this technique you’ll use it fairly often.\\nSee the example above and below for how you would normally go about list comprehension with a for loop vs. creating your list with in one simple line with no loops necessary.\\nEver get tired of creating function after function for limited use cases? Lambda functions to the rescue! Lambda functions are used for creating small, one-time and anonymous function objects in Python. Basically, they let you create a function, without creating a function.\\nThe basic syntax of lambda functions is:\\nNote that lambda functions can do everything that regular functions can do, as long as there’s just one expression. Check out the simple example below and the upcoming video to get a better feel for the power of lambda functions:\\nOnce you have a grasp on lambda functions, learning to pair them with the map and filter functions can be a powerful tool.\\nSpecifically, map takes in a list and transforms it into a new list by performing some sort of operation on each element. In this example, it goes through each element and maps the result of itself times 2 to a new list. Note that the list function simply converts the output to list type.\\nThe filter function takes in a list and a rule, much like map, however it returns a subset of the original list by comparing each element against the boolean filtering rule.\\nFor creating quick and easy Numpy arrays, look no further than the arange and linspace functions. Each one has their specific purpose, but the appeal here (instead of using range), is that they output NumPy arrays, which are typically easier to work with for data science.\\nArange returns evenly spaced values within a given interval. Along with a starting and stopping point, you can also define a step size or data type if necessary. Note that the stopping point is a ‘cut-off’ value, so it will not be included in the array output.\\nLinspace is very similar, but with a slight twist. Linspace returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. So given a starting and stopping point, as well as a number of values, linspace will evenly space them out for you in a NumPy array. This is especially helpful for data visualizations and declaring axes when plotting.\\nYou may have ran into this when dropping a column in Pandas or summing values in NumPy matrix. If not, then you surely will at some point. Let’s use the example of dropping a column for now:\\nI don’t know how many times I wrote this line of code before I actually knew why I was declaring axis what I was. As you can probably deduce from above, set axis to 1 if you want to deal with columns and set it to 0 if you want rows. But why is this? My favorite reasoning, or atleast how I remember this:\\nCalling the shape attribute from a Pandas dataframe gives us back a tuple with the first value representing the number of rows and the second value representing the number of columns. If you think about how this is indexed in Python, rows are at 0 and columns are at 1, much like how we declare our axis value. Crazy, right?\\nIf you’re familiar with SQL, then these concepts will probably come a lot easier for you. Anyhow, these functions are essentially just ways to combine dataframes in specific ways. It can be difficult to keep track of which is best to use at which time, so let’s review it.\\nConcat allows the user to append one or more dataframes to each other either below or next to it (depending on how you define the axis).\\nMerge combines multiple dataframes on specific, common columns that serve as the primary key.\\nJoin, much like merge, combines two dataframes. However, it joins them based on their indices, rather than some specified column.\\nCheck out the excellent Pandas documentation for specific syntax and more concrete examples, as well as some special cases that you may run into.\\nThink of apply as a map function, but made for Pandas DataFrames or more specifically, for Series. If you’re not as familiar, Series are pretty similar to NumPy arrays for the most part.\\nApply sends a function to every element along a column or row depending on what you specify. You might imagine how useful this can be, especially for formatting and manipulating values across a whole DataFrame column, without having to loop at all.\\nLast but certainly not least is pivot tables. If you’re familiar with Microsoft Excel, then you’ve probably heard of pivot tables in some respect. The Pandas built-in pivot_table function creates a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. Note that the levels in the pivot table are stored in MultiIndex objects on the index and columns of the resulting DataFrame.\\nThat’s it for now. I hope a couple of these overviews have effectively jogged your memory regarding important yet somewhat tricky methods, functions, and concepts you frequently encounter when using Python for data science. Personally, I know that even the act of writing these out and trying to explain them in simple terms has helped me out a ton.\\nIf you’re interested in receiving my weekly rundown of interesting articles and resources focused on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, then subscribe to Self Driven Data Science using the form below!\\nIf you enjoyed this post, feel free to hit the clap button and if you’re interested in posts to come, make sure to follow me on Medium at the link below — I’ll be writing and shipping every day this month as part of a 30-Day Challenge.\\nThis article was originally published on conordewey.com\\nFrom a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story.\\nData Scientist & Writer | www.conordewey.com\\nSharing concepts, ideas, and codes.\\n'"]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["dataset[1]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e79dc7e-f81a-4a11-885d-92be126ba05d","_uuid":"1f5a0819-a71c-4529-9997-54ef4f3fd0a7","trusted":true},"source":["## 1.1.

By pitting two such disparate concepts against one another (instead of seeing them as separate entities designed to serve different purposes) we discouraged bot development. Building a bot for the sake of it, letting it loose and hoping for the best will never end well:\n","The vast majority of bots are built using decision-tree logic, where the bot’s canned response relies on spotting specific keywords in the user input. Sure, there are some concepts that we can only express using language (“show me all the ways of getting to a museum that give me 2000 steps but don’t take longer than 35 minutes”), but most tasks can be carried out more efficiently and intuitively with GUIs than with a conversational UI. Today’s rule-based dialogue systems are too brittle to deal with this kind of unpredictability, and statistical approaches using machine learning are just as limited. Modern day bots, whether they use typed or spoken input, have to face all these challenges, but also work in an efficient and scalable way on a variety of platforms. Another bunch of scientists were developing speech-processing software so that you could just speak to your computer, rather than having to type. Meanwhile, a bunch of research scientists were busily developing natural language (NL) interfaces to databases, instead of having to learn an arcane database query language. This turned out to be a whole lot more difficult than anyone originally realised:\n","The next item on the agenda was holding a two-way dialog with a machine. Humans can read between the lines, leverage contextual information and understand double layers like sarcasm. It was carefully crafted to deal with conversations involving VCRs, and could only operate within strict limitations. Conversational UIs are meant to replicate the way humans prefer to communicate, but they end up requiring extra cognitive effort. That’s because machines let us access vast and complex information systems, and the early graphical information systems were a revolutionary leap forward in helping us locate those systems. A competent developer can build a basic bot in minutes — but one that can hold a conversation? Today’s most successful bot experiences take a hybrid approach, incorporating chat into a broader strategy that encompasses more traditional elements. Tapping or selecting is obviously preferable to typing out a whole sentence, even with predictive (often error-prone ) text. At the end of the day, no amount of witty quips or human-like mannerisms will save a bot from conversational failure. If there’s one thing that’s broken about sales and marketing, it’s the lack of humanity: brands hide behind ticket numbers, feedback forms, do-not-reply-emails, automated responses and gated ‘contact us’ forms. As Matt Asay outlines, this results in another issue: failure to capture the attention and creativity of developers. But in terms of consumer response and developer involvement, chatbots haven’t lived up to the hype generated circa 2015/16.  \n","\n","article 1 This is especially helpful for data visualizations and declaring axes when plotting. Apply sends a function to every element along a column or row depending on what you specify. Linspace is very similar, but with a slight twist. For creating quick and easy Numpy arrays, look no further than the arange and linspace functions. The filter function takes in a list and a rule, much like map, however it returns a subset of the original list by comparing each element against the boolean filtering rule. Each one has their specific purpose, but the appeal here (instead of using range), is that they output NumPy arrays, which are typically easier to work with for data science.

First, let’s take a look at our example data. The best way to think of a relationship between two tables is the analogy of parent to child. For example, if our goal is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan, we could look for the features most correlated with a specified outcome. The complete dataframe has 793 columns of new features! Deep feature synthesis stacks multiple transformation and aggregation operations (which are called feature primitives in the vocab of featuretools) to create features from data spread across many tables. Although Pandas is a great resource, there’s only so much data manipulation we want to do by hand! Ideally, we want a solution that can automatically perform transformations and aggregations across multiple tables and combine the resulting data into a single table. (For more on manual feature engineering check out the excellent Python Data Science Handbook). In fact, the amount of data needed for the model to perform well scales exponentially with the number of features. Featuretools is based on a method known as “Deep Feature Synthesis”, which sounds a lot more imposing than it actually is (the name comes from stacking multiple features not because it uses deep learning!). To do this, we use the same ft.dfs function call but do not pass in any feature primitives:\n","Featuretools has built many new features for us to use. That is, each value in the index must appear in the table only once. The clients and the loans table are linked via the client_id variable and loans and payments are linked with the loan_id. When we add this entity to the entityset, we need to pass in the parameter make_index = True and specify the name of the index. A feature with a depth of two is LAST(loans(MEAN(payments.payment_amount)) This is made by stacking two aggregations: LAST (most recent) on top of MEAN. In future articles, I’ll show how to use this technique on a real world problem, the Home Credit Default Risk competition currently being hosted on Kaggle. Automated feature engineering has solved one problem, but created another: too many features. Below is a list of some of the feature primitives in featuretools (we can also define custom primitives):\n","These primitives can be used by themselves or combined to create features. Our models are only as good as the data we give them, and automated feature engineering can help to make the feature creation process more efficient.  \n","\n","article 3 There are tons of resources available.

First, we’ll initialize all Q values at equal values. Surprisingly, we can use the same approach as before. The way we do this with deep learning is by having both be two separate outputs of the same backbone neural network, which will make it easier for our neural network to learn good representations. In the maze for example, there were 49 states (squares) and 4 actions (move in each adjacent direction). This is a classic problem called Multi-armed bandits and is where we will start. Below, is a comprehensive overview of many of the main algorithms that power Deep RL today. A tall order! For a more complete set of tutorials, Arthur Juliani wrote an 8-part series starting here. Image-based Learning combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with RL. Each of them have a different average payout, and your goal is to maximize the total payout you receive after a fixed number of turns. The way that we encourage exploration is by using a method called entropy regularization, which pushes our probability estimates to be wider, and thus will encourage us to make riskier choices to explore the space. Eventually, we learn which chests are best. The idea is to only look at a limited number of steps in the future. Most real-word problems consist of many different states. This constrains our learning process, as we have to have an exploration strategy that is built in to the policy itself, but allows us to tie results directly to our reasoning, and enables us to learn more efficiently. 6/Nuanced actions\n","So far, we’ve played with environments with continuous and discrete state spaces. We learn our policy directly with policy gradients (defined above), and learn a value function using something called Advantage. This consists of playing out the entire episode with our current policy until we reach an end (success by reaching a green block or failure by reaching a red block in the image above) and use that result to update our value estimates for each traversed state. In this environment called 3D ball world, we can choose to tilt the paddle to any value on each of its axes.  \n","\n","article 5 And this idea is really what a lot of earlier computer vision feature extraction methods were based around. The bias gets added to the output channel so far to produce the final output channel. A dense layer attempting to halve the input to 75,000 inputs would still require over 10 billion parameters. This, as mentioned earlier, is often done through strides or pooling layers. So the key difference we make with deep learning is ask this question: Can useful kernels be learnt? The kernels of a filter each produce one version of each channel, and the filter as a whole produces one overall output channel. Each filter actually happens to be a collection of kernels, with there being one kernel for every single input channel to the layer, and each kernel being unique. So this is where a key distinction between terms comes in handy: whereas in the 1 channel case, where the term filter and kernel are interchangeable, in the general case, they’re actually pretty different. Each filter in a convolution layer produces one and only one output channel, and they do it like so:\n","Each of the kernels of the filter “slides” over their respective input channels, producing a processed version of each. Even if were we to apply a kernel of the same size (3×3), having the same local area, to the output of the strided convolution, the kernel would have a larger effective receptive field:\n","This is because the output of the strided layer still does represent the same image. Each of the per-channel processed versions are then summed together to form one channel. And this is where the idea of the receptive field comes in. Each output node only gets to see a select number of inputs (the ones inside the kernel). which apps people want most) that can be found, but that gives us no reason to believe the parameters for the first two are exactly the same as the parameters for the latter two. For example, when you use a pretrained model for image classification, you use the pretrained network parameters as your prior, as a feature extractor to your final densely connected layer. Using this, we can peek into the learnt filters, and the results are stunning:\n","One important thing to notice here is that convolved images are still images. Compared to earlier layers, where an activation meant detecting an edge, here, an activation on the tiny 7×7 grid is one for a very high level feature, such as for birds. The receptive field determines what area of the original input to the entire network the output gets to see. For instance, for edge detection, one can use a Sobel edge detection filter, a kernel with fixed parameters, operating just like the standard one-channel convolution:\n","For a non-edge containing grid (eg.

Let’s look at a few examples to see these concepts in action. A transformation acts on a single table (thinking in terms of Python, a table is just a Pandas DataFrame ) by creating new features out of one or more of the existing columns. Here’s how we would do that in Python using the language of Pandas. Although Pandas is a great resource, there’s only so much data manipulation we want to do by hand! ( Deep feature synthesis stacks multiple transformation and aggregation operations (which are called feature primitives in the vocab of featuretools) to create features from data spread across many tables. Like most ideas in machine learning, it’s a complex method built on a foundation of simple concepts. By learning one building block at a time, we can form a good understanding of this powerful method. Each entity must have an index, which is a column with all unique elements. We add an entity with an existing index to an entityset using the following syntax:\n","The loans dataframe also has a unique index, loan_id and the syntax to add this to the entityset is the same as for clients. Also, although featuretools will automatically infer the data type of each column in an entity, we can override this by passing in a dictionary of column types to the parameter variable_types . Next, we need to specify how the tables in the entityset are related. After adding entities and formalizing relationships, our entityset is complete and we are ready to make features. We already know what these are, but we have just been calling them by different names! For example, we have the month each client joined which is a transformation feature primitive:\n","We also have a number of aggregation primitives such as the average payment amounts for each client:\n","Even though we specified only a few feature primitives, featuretools created many new features by combining and stacking these primitives. A deep feature is simply a feature made of stacking multiple primitives and dfs is the name of process that makes these features. After this point, the features are difficult to interpret, but I encourage anyone interested to try “going deeper”. Although it’s difficult to say before fitting a model which of these features will be important, it’s likely not all of them will be relevant to a task we want to train our model on. Moreover, having too many features can lead to poor model performance because the less useful features drown out those that are more important.

On the other hand, Deep Reinforcement Learning focuses on the right sequences of sentences that will lead to a positive outcome, for example a happy customer. This makes Deep RL particularly attractive for tasks that require planning and adaptation, such as manufacturing or self-driving. A major reason is that Deep RL often requires an agent to experiment millions of times before learning anything useful. The best way to do this rapidly is by using a simulation environment.

Do take note of this, as it’ll be critical to our later discussion. Before we move on, it’s definitely worth looking into two techniques that are commonplace in convolution layers: Padding and Strides. A stride of 1 means to pick slides a pixel apart, so basically every single slide, acting as a standard convolution. In practicality, most input images have 3 channels, and that number only increases the deeper you go into a network. The bias gets added to the output channel so far to produce the final output channel. If we were to use a kernel K of size 3 on the reshaped 4×4 input to get a 2×2 output, the equivalent transformation matrix would be:\n","(Note: while the above matrix is an equivalent transformation matrix, the actual operation is usually implemented as a very different matrix multiplication[2])\n","The convolution then, as a whole, is still a linear transformation, but at the same time it’s also a dramatically different kind of transformation. For comparison, the entirety of ResNet-50 has some 25 million parameters. Sure, the four may have an underlying higher level feature (eg. The four could’ve been in any (consistent) order and still be valid! For instance, for edge detection, one can use a Sobel edge detection filter, a kernel with fixed parameters, operating just like the standard one-channel convolution:\n","For a non-edge containing grid (eg. the background sky), most of the pixels are the same value, so the overall output of the kernel at that point is 0. So the key difference we make with deep learning is ask this question: Can useful kernels be learnt? One of the most powerful tools to come out of that is Feature Visualization using optimization[3]. We then apply a nonlinearity to the output, and per usual, then stack another new convolution layer on top. And this is where things get interesting. Even if were we to apply a kernel of the same size (3×3), having the same local area, to the output of the strided convolution, the kernel would have a larger effective receptive field:\n","This is because the output of the strided layer still does represent the same image. Both are methods of increasing the receptive field, but dilated convolutions are a single layer, while this takes place on a regular convolution following a strided convolution, with a nonlinearity inbetween)\n","This expansion of the receptive field allows the convolution layers to combine the low level features (lines, edges), into higher level features (curves, textures), as we see in the mixed3a layer. Compared to what a standard feedforward network would have done, the output here is really nothing short of awe-inspiring. A standard feedforward network would have produced abstract feature vectors, from combinations of every single pixel in the image, requiring intractable amounts of data to train. The most major problem: Adversarial Examples[4], examples which have been specifically modified to fool the model. This opens the door for models to silently fail, which can be pretty dangerous for a wide range of applications from self-driving cars to healthcare. They might be the key method in computer vision going forward, or some other new breakthrough might just be around the corner.

Put simply, machine learning is a “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” (Arthur Samuel, 1959). Now is the best time to learn about machine learning and apply it to the products you are building. Machine learning can help create user-centric products by personalizing experiences to the individuals who use them. Knowing this, we can help prepare for a user’s next action. Depending on the application and what data is available, there are different types of machine learning algorithms to choose from. Labeled data is a group of examples that has informative tags or outputs. number of bedrooms, location) and its price. If the output we are trying to predict is a number we call it regression. Unsupervised learning is helpful when we have unlabeled data or we are not exactly sure what outputs (like an image’s hashtags or a house’s price) are meaningful. Understanding the problem you are trying to solve and the available data will constrain the types of machine learning you can use (e.q. In some cases, you can set out to collect data that is not already available or consider other approaches. \n","\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:870: FutureWarning: The default value of `n_init` will change from 10 to 'auto' in 1.4.

Long story short, I’ve decided to sort through all my bookmarks and notes in order to deliver a comprehensive list of data science resources. These were some of my favorite full-coverage questions to practice with right before an interview. As far as language goes, most companies will let you use whatever language you want. It may come up as a conceptual question regarding cross validation or bias-variance tradeoff, or it may take the form of a take home assignment with a dataset attached. Most interviews will have atleast one section solely dedicated to product thinking which often lends itself to A/B testing of some sort. Make sure your familiar with the concepts and statistical background necessary in order to be prepared when it comes up. If you only check out one section here, this is the one to focus on.

Some examples of concepts in AI that come from Information theory or related fields:\n","In the early 20th century, scientists and engineers were struggling with the question: “How to quantify the information? How can we quantify the difference between two sentences? Semantics, domain and form of data only added to the complexity of the problem. So, we can say that exp 1 is inherently more uncertain/unpredictable than exp 2. The probability distribution of experiment is used to calculate the entropy. A deterministic experiment, which is completely predictable, say tossing a coin with P(H)=1, has entropy zero. It tells us how similar two distributions are. Cross entropy between two probability distributions p and q defined over same set of outcomes is given by:\n","Mutual information is a measure of mutual dependency between two probability distributions or random variables.
